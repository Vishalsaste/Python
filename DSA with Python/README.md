## Data Structures and Algorithm

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and the design of procedures (algorithms) for solving problems, which operate on these data structures.

### Common Data Structures :

### Linked list
A linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers.

#### Types of Linked List.
     1 - Singly Linkedlist
     
     2 - Doubly Linkedlist

     3 - Circular Linkedlist
 

### Stack and Queue

### Stack -

A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.

#### The functions associated with stack are:

     empty() 
     – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1)

     size() 
     – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)

     top() / peek() 
     – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)

     push(a) 
     – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)

     pop() 
     – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)

### Queue -

Like a stack, the queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue, the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

#### Operations associated with queue are: 

- #### Enqueue: 
     -Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)

- #### Dequeue:
     -Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)

- #### Front:
     -Get the front item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
- #### Rear:
     -Get the last item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)

### Tree 

Tree Data Structure is a hierarchical data structure in which a collection of elements known as nodes are connected to each other via edges such that there exists exactly one path between any two nodes.

- General Tree
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree

### Graph

A Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It’s used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.
