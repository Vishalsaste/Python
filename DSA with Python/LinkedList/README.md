  ##  Linked lists

     Three types of linked lists
     
     1 - Singly Linkedlist
     
     2 - Doubly Linkedlist

     3 - Circular Linkedlist

## 1 - Singly Linkedlist

Singly linked list. Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a 'value' field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.

### Operations - 
     
- insertion
- deletion
- traversal


## a - insertion

     Add / insert element in singly Linkedlist

     - at the beginning
     - at the ending
     - in between nodes
    
### -at the beginning

### -at the ending

## b - deletion

     Delete / remove element in singly Linkedlist

     - at First
     - at Last
     - at Middle

### -at First

## c - traversal

  Traversing through the nodes will allow us to print all the elements in a linked list. In order to traverse through a linked list, we need to start at the head of the linked list and move to the next node and repeat this process till we reach the end, which is denoted by NULL in the linked list.
