  -  Linked lists

     Three types of linked lists
     
     1 - Singly Linkedlist
     
     2 - Doubly Linkedlist

     3 - Circular Linkedlist

1 - Singly Linkedlist

Singly linked list. Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a 'value' field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.

Operations - 
     
- insertion
- deletion
- traversal


1 - insertion

     Add / insert element in singly Linkedlist

     - at the beginning
     - at the ending
     - in between nodes

2 - deletion

     Delete / remove element in singly Linkedlist

     - at First
     - at Last
     - at Middle
