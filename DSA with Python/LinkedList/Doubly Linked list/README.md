A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.

- deletion
- traversal


## 1 - insertion

     Add / insert element in doubly Linkedlist

     - insertion when empty
     - at the beginning
     - at the ending
     - after a node
     - before a node 

## 2 - deletion

     Delete / remove element in doubly Linkedlist
